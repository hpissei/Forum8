# Code Implemenation
The code is implemented in .Net 6 using C# which is a Console App.
We can run this solution by building it in Visual Studio 2019 or by installing the .Net 6 version if not already present.
In case if visual studio 2019 is not present we can run the code from "cmd" using below commands.
  - Building the solution by using the following command :-
     - dotnet build

     - cd Forum8
     - dotnet run

 - I have uploaded a private fiddle also which we can check online without need to install anything. Link:-https://dotnetfiddle.net/8kpJtB

# 2. An explanation of your algorithm choice
  - I have programmed the solution using custom algorithm for sorting the array I have used Insertion Sort.
    
# 3. Time and space complexity.

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|--------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Insertion Sort |  O(N^2)         |	O(1)            |
| Unique Pairs   |  O(N^2)	       |  O(1)            |
